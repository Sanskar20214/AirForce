Indian Air Force Aircraft Data Scraper
This project is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to extract and aggregate data from the Wikipedia page List of active Indian military aircraft. The script fetches the data for each aircraft, aggregates the "In Service" numbers for all variants of an aircraft, and outputs the result as a CSV file.

Scrape data from the Wikipedia page to get the list of active Indian Air Force aircraft.
